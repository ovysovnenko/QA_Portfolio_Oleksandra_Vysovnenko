**Overview:**  
This project demonstrates my exploratory testing of a Ticket Cancellation Form.  
I created 30 manual test cases (BVA, EP, positive/negative), logged 5 defects, and prepared a short test plan and test summary report.  
The focus was on validation, field behaviour, and dropdown functionality.
