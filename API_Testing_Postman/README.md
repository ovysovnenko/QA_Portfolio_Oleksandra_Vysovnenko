Overview:
This project demonstrates my manual functional API testing of the DummyJSON service.
I created 10 test cases (positive and negative) to verify basic CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete — using Postman.
The goal was to validate correct response codes and body structures.
Some negative tests failed due to environment limitations (DummyJSON does not persist or validate data).
All documentation was prepared manually in Microsoft Office and uploaded to GitHub.
